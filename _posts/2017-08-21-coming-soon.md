Welcome to From All Fifty! We're glad you're here, though we apologize for the lack of reading material. We'll have some great content for you shortly; but here's a little teaser while you wait.

## Our Model
At From All Fifty, we're working to deliver you interesting opinions from progressive difference makers across the country. 

Every Monday at 5pm, we post a chat on a contemporary issue, involving a handful of civic leaders from across the United States. We work hard to locate leaders with interesting and relevant opinions on the subject-- opinions that differ from what you might normally hear.

The participants? They may not be household names now, but the household names of tomorrow. We're looking for experts, visionaries, those who are going to shape the America of tomorrow.
