## What We Do
From All Fifty is all about discussing progressive solutions to contemporary problems. The highlight of From All Fifty posts is the chat. We find the leaders and thinkers in progressive politics all across the United States (and occasionally the world). Then, they're let loose in a [Slack chat](https://slack.com) to discuss answers to the question of the day with light moderation.

Many of our guests aren't household names (though they might be soon). We view this as a positive: you're hearing from different voices than you would on CNN or in most media sources. We think it's critical to get out of our daily information bubble, and by presenting a broad range of ideas, that's exactly what we attempt to do.

## Who We Are
From All Fifty is run by Erik Partridge of [Cents for Change](https://centsforchange.net). Erik's a passionate Democrat, and has experience working with Republicans too. Hailing from Michigan, Erik worked in communications and legislative affairs in the State Senate prior to starting From All Fifty. When not talking politics, he enjoys reading, eating ice cream, and playing volleyball. Today, Erik is a senior at McGill University in Montreal, Canada.

Interested in joining us? We're not currently hiring, but please consider dropping us a message on [AngelList](https://angel.co/cents-for-change).
